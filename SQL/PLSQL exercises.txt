Exercise 2: 

procedure 2 is more preferable; because it's performance is better ( faster), because procedure 1 has a cursor and multiple queries (multiple select statements) for the same data which will go over the table, which takes so much time complexity ;
while procedure 2 has single query which is much faster;


Exercise 3:

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE ConvertIPToNumber(p_ip_address IN VARCHAR2, p_result OUT NUMBER) IS
BEGIN
    
    p_result := TO_NUMBER(REPLACE(p_ip_address, '.', ''));
END ConvertIPToNumber;
/
DECLARE
    v_result NUMBER;
BEGIN
    ConvertIPToNumber('10.1.255.34', v_result);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Converted IP to number: ' || v_result);
END;
/
